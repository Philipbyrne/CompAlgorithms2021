This is a repository full of my practical work as part of my Algorithms module as a second year student in UCD. Within this repository I have completed worksheets and implemented different algorithms. The main things I did during this module are analysing algorithms and their complexity, recursion, sorting algorithms, searching, tries and data compression.

---

### Practical 1 - Algorithm Analysis

---

During this practical I looked at analysing algorithms using tables and graphs in order to see how efficient an algorithm is. I graphed our results when testing algorithms I was given and had to decide which algorithm was most efficient.

---

### Practical 2 - Complexity Analysis

---

This practical focused on time complexity of algorithms and the Big O notation. I had to write my own version of the Russian Peasants algorithm and tests it with different sizes of data in order to gain a better understanding of time complexity. I then had to calculate the time complexity of my algorithm.

---

### Practical 3 - Recursion

---

For this practical I looked into recursion and how it works. I compared the iterative and recursive fibonacci algorithms with regards to complexity. I then worked on developing a recursive algorithm for a solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem.

---
### Practical 4 - Sorting Algorithms

---

The main focus of this practical was on sorting. I developed a selection sort, insertion sort and bogo sort algorithm. I then had to compare these on the grounds of complexity and efficiency. My findings were then graphed and I calculated the complexity of each algorithm.

---

### Practical 5 - MergeSort

---

During this practical I worked on the merge sort algorithm. I then created an enhanced version of this sorting algorithm which used insertion sort to handle smaller data.

---

### Practical 6 - QuickSort

---

Quicksort was the main focus of this practical. I had to develop my own quick sort algorithm. Just like practical 6, I had to write my own enhanced version of quick sort in which I shuffled the array of ints beforehand and used insertion sort when working with smaller data.

---

### Practical 7 - Search Algorithms

---

I implemented both a brute force substring search algorithm and a version of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm during this practical. I then assessed the performance of each and found the complexity of both of the algorithms.

---

### Practical 8 - Tries

---

In this practical, I looked into the concept of tries. I wrote out in english how insertion and search works in a trie through an example. I then implemented a trie in java.

---

### Practical 9 - Data Compression

---

The main focus of this practical was on building a run length encoded function that takes in any string inputs and outputs the compressed output. This reduces the size of the string so time can be saved when transmitting the output. I created an algorithm that uses run length coding that encodes and decodes input strings. I then performed tests on compression using different types of files and documuented this.
